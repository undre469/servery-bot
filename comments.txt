I was pleased with the service of the workers; they were very nice it didnt not take longer then 1 min to get my food and it was very fresh
The flavor on the Buffalo Garlic Blaze boneless wings is solid—spicy with a sweet garlicky kick. But the texture is hit-or-miss. Sometimes they’re crispy, other times a bit chewy. Still good if you’re craving wings, but they’re not the main attraction.
Zaxby’s never misses for me. I ordered the Chicken Finger Plate and everything was hot, fresh, and cooked perfectly. The toast was buttery, the fries were crispy, and that Zax Sauce? Still undefeated.
What really stood out, though, was the staff. The young guy at the register was polite and upbeat, and a manager checked in to see if everything was good. That kind of attention is rare in fast food.
Tried the chocolate chip cookie on a whim—warm and gooey! The staff joked around with me in line, and the whole atmosphere felt welcoming.
